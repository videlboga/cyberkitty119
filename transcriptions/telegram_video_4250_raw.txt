he's about to say his first words we're gonna remember this forever here he goes nostalgia is a beautiful liar it shows you highlight reels while hiding all the reasons things ended you scroll through old photos replay conversations and convince yourself that what's gone was better than what remains but clinging to memories keeps you trapped between worlds, physically here but mentally living in moments that no longer exist. You're giving your present away to ghosts who have already moved on with their lives. The hardest truth is that you're often remembering alone. While you're analyzing every detail of what used to be, they've created new stories that don't include you. They found peace by letting go of what you still hold on to. Your mind wasn't designed to live in the past. It was made for right now. for building new connections, for healing, for growing beyond what was. The memories worth keeping are the ones that gently inform your future, not the ones that hold it hostage. Let the past stay where it belongs. Today needs you more.
